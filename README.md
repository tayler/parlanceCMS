parlanceCMS
===========

A blogging CMS built with Opa

Introduction
============

When I first heard about it, I was impressed by Opa. I wanted to learn it. 
What better way to learn a new language than to take on an overly-ambitious project?

Installation
============

1. install Opa: https://github.com/MLstate/opalang/wiki/Getting-started
2. navigate to parlance root directory, and run the command `make run`
